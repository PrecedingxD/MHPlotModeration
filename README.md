# MHPlotModeration

This plugin was created to assist in moderation with plots on Minehut's build contest server. I've decided to open source it as I thought that it may be of use to some who run plot servers. It depends on [PlotSquared](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plotsquared-v7.77506/). 

## Commands:
- `/moderation next` Teleports you to the next plot in the moderation queue.
- `/moderation remove` Removes the plot that you're standing in from the moderation queue.

# Permissions
- `mhplots.mod` Allows users with this permission to use `/moderation` and get notified about new plots in the queue when joining the server.
